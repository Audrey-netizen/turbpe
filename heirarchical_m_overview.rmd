aka heirarchical linear regression
from what I can tell, for this poster the data can be very simple?
  just compare linear models, gradually adding a variable to each
    ... well, that depends on the scope of our data...
  harder part arguably is visualization, not just making it
  possible but deciding which is approriate for this poster
